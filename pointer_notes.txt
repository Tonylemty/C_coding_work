Pointer is a variables that store address of another variable

2.Example to introduct
eg.
int a = 5;
int *p; -> Computer would allocate a memory address for p, and p is a pointer for interger
p = &a; -> p points to the address of a 
print p -> get the address of a
print &a -> get the address of a
print &p -> get the address of p
print *p -> get the value of 5 -> This calls Dereferencing

-> p is address; *p is a value at address
